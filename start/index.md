# Getting Started

You should fall into one of the two categories below. Pick one, and we'll walk you through getting started.

<div class="horiz-columns row">
  <div class="consumers col-md-6">
    <h2>Consumers</h2>

    <div class="left">
      <img src="/img/consumers.png" alt="Consumers" />
    </div>

    <p>Are you a citizen software developer looking to build something with open data? Are you looking to consume data from a government, NGO, non-profit, or other organization that uses
    Socrata? Look no further!</p>

    <a class="btn btn-large" href="/consumers/getting-started">Start consuming data now</a>
  </div>
  <div class="publishers col-md-6">
    <h2>Publishers</h2>
    <div class="left">
      <a href="/publishers/getting-started"><img src="/img/publishers.png" alt="Publishers" /></a>
    </div>
    <p>Are you a developer for a Socrata customer who wants to start publishing data programatically to their instance of the Socrata platform? Or are you a developer interested in building
    applications to collect data using Socrata?</p>

    <a class="btn btn-large" href="/publishers/getting-started">Start publishing data now</a>
  </div>
</div>
