The ability to write to a Socrata dataset requires you to own that dataset or be granted permission to write to it. This might not apply to you. Unless you're already a [Socrata customer](http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/), you have a few other options:

- Sign up for an account on [opendata.socrata.com](http://opendata.socrata.com), our public portal where you can create a limited number of datasets for free.
- If you're a member of a community group working on open data, request the creation of a [Socrata Community Portal](http://communities.socrata.com).
- Get hired by one of our wonderful customers. :)
