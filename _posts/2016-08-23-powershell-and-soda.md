[PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is a automation and configuration tool that is optimized for dealing with structured data (such as JSON and XML).   It was recently open-sourced by Microsoft and runs on Windows, Linux, and OS X.   

To get data from a Socrata Open Data Endpoint in PowerShell, it is as easy as calling the [Invoke-RestMethod](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849971.aspx) cmdlet:
{% highlight powershell %}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://data.oregon.gov/resource/uq5y-tk6r.json -Method get
{% endhighlight %}
A full example of inserting data can be found in the [Active Directory attributes to Socrata Github](https://github.com/joeywas/active-directory-attributes-to-socrata)
