### Setting Up

The site is a fairly standard [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, but there are a few steps you'll want to make first to ensure that everything compiles properly:

1. Make sure you have the `gh-pages` branch checked out: `git checkout -b gh-pages origin/gh-pages`
2. Pull in the site templates and CSS/SASS, which come from submodules: `git submodule update --init`
3. Make sure you have Ruby version 2.0.0-p353 installed. (`rbenv install 2.0.0-p353` if RBEnv is your thing).
4. Make sure you have the `jekyll` RubyGem installed
  * A `.rvmrc` [RVM](http://rvm.io/) configuration file is included if that's your thing
  * Install the `bundler gem` and then install the gems from the Gemfile: `gem install bundler && bundle`
5. Build the site and run the local server: `jekyll serve --watch`. To speed up page re-building you can disable plugins by running `jekyll serve --watch --safe`

You can now view your local server at <http://localhost:4000> (unless you changed the port number).

### Modifying CSS/SASS

Site styling is controlled via `css/local.sass` and it's automatically regenerated by Github Pages with each push.
