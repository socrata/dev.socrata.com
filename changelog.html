<h1>API Changelog</h1>

<p>Every API must change from time to time. While we strive to keep breaking changes to a minimum, some changes in behavior may affect your application. Many changes also bring new or enhanced functionality to the API.</p>

{% for change in site.pages reversed %}
  {% if change.type == 'change' %}
    <h2>{{ change.date }}: {{ change.title }}</h2>

    {{ change.content | markdownify }}
