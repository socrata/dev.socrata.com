[Safe Software](http://www.safe.com) has partnered with Socrata to build an FME "writer" for Socrata. Using the Socrata Writer, you can easily create workflows to extract data from [350+ source systems/formats](http://www.safe.com/fme/format-search/) using [Safe FME](http://www.safe.com/fme/fme-technology/), perform cleanup and transformation, and publish that data to Socrata.

For more information about using FME and Socrata refer to these resources:
