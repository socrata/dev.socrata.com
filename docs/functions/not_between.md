`not between` is used with the `$where` parameter to return numeric or time stamp values excluding those between two input values. For example, to get all of the individuals who make less than $40,000 or more than $150,000 at the City of Chicago:

{% include tryit.html domain='data.cityofchicago.org' path='/resource/tt4n-kn4t.json' args="$where=annual_salary not between '40000' and '150000'" %}

It can also be used on [Floating Timestamps](/docs/datatypes/floating_timestamp.html). For example, to get all of the crimes that occurred outside noon and 2PM on January 10th, 2015 in Chicago:

{% include tryit.html domain='data.cityofchicago.org' path='/resource/6zsd-86xi.json' args="$where=date not between '2015-01-10T12:00:00' and '2015-01-10T14:00:00'" %}
