## Response Codes

The Socrata Open Data API responds with standard [HTTP Status Codes](https://http.dog/) for both successful requests and for errors. The table below lists the response codes you should expect to see. 

| Code                          | Error          | Description         |
| ---                           | ---            |
{% for e in site.data.response_codes %} | <a href="{{ e.url }}" class="code {{ e.class }}">{{e.code}}</a> | `{{ e.name }}` | {{ e.description }} |
{% endfor %}

## Headers

For [SODA 2.1](/docs/endpoints.html) API calls, we include a few response headers that may be useful:

| Header | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `X-Socrata-RequestId` | `aqe1bgaxzvhitfgrsvy6semhi` | A unique ID for this particular request. _Very_ useful to include when [asking for help](/support.html), as it allows us to track your error down in our system |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | `*` | Allows browsers to make [cross-origin requests](/docs/cors-and-jsonp.html) for data |
| `X-SODA2-Fields` | `["business","category", ...]` (truncated) | An array of the field names that may be included in this response |
| `X-SODA2-Types` | `["text","text",...]` (truncated) | An array of the [data types](/docs/datatypes/) for fields included in this response |
| `Last-Modified` | `Tue, 24 Feb 2015 18:51:22 GMT` | an [HTTP header](https://http.dev/last-modified) for when the dataset backing this request was updated; may be used for caching |
| `ETag` | `"YWxwaGEuNTQzNV8...-gzip"` (truncated) | An [HTTP ETag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) which may be used for cache validation |

There may be other headers included in responses, but they should not be relied upon and may change without notice.

<p class="alert alert-info">[HTTP Headers](https://http.dev/headers) are limited by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/686217/maximum-on-http-header-values">practical constraints to a maximum size of 4K</a>. In order to keep our request header sizes below that limit, the <code>X-SODA2-Fields</code> and <code>X-SODA2-Types</code> headers may be omitted for datasets with a very large number of columns.</p>

## Error Messages

For any variety of error, we return a standard error message format that looks like the following:

<pre><code>
{
  "code": "query.compiler.malformed",
  "error": true,
  "message": "Could not parse SoQL query \"select * where string_column > 42\"",
  "data": {
    "query": "select * where string_column > 42"
  }
}
</code></pre>

In particular:

- `code`: An enumeration for the particular class of error you have encountered
- `error`: A boolean flag you can check in your code if your library masks the HTTP error code. Ex: `if(response.error) { // handle error }`
- `message`: A human-readable error message that will help you debug what caused the error
- `data`: Machine-readable data about the error, most importantly the query generated by our SoQL parser based on your inputs
